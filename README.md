# MKS SERVO42B
## Features
- Based on the open project of nano_stepper by Misfittech:[https://github.com/Misfittech/nano_stepper](http:://github.com/Misfittech/nano_stepper "https://github.com/Misfittech/nano_stepper").
- To improve performance, Makerbase Team has made the following changes:
- Ported the project to STMicroelectronics' 32-bit MCU, STM32F103C8T6 ARM 32-bit Cortex™-M3 CPU Core,72 MHz maximum frequency,20k RAM. 64k Flash
- Changed the magnetic encoder to Allegro's A1333LLETR-T Contactless 0° to 360° angle sensor IC ,12bit
- Ported the compilation platform from arduino to PlatformIO —— Convenient  for STM32 MCU compilation
- Change the socket with motherboard, now it can work with much 3D printer motherboards using MKS SV_EXT V1.1 by Makerbase
- This project support build and upload by platformio, you can use Atom or Code editor (need install platformio) build it or upload  firmware. Please refer to the following method:
